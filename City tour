/*A vertex is considered as a point with both its coordinates as integers.

You are initially at the origin of a 2D surface. You can move by the following rules:

One move is counted as a vertex to an adjacent vertex. You cannot jump, and can only move to an adjacent vertex. For example, if you are at point A(x,y) , then you may move to any of the points  B, C, D, E (defined below),
                   A(x,y)  to  B(x,y-1) or C(x,y+1) or D(x+1,y) or E(x-1,y)

 

Distance from origin should increase with each move.*/
